# ui-project-fall24
What culpa doesnt tell you

We used HTML,CSS and python to develop these interfaces. We store our changes using a flask backend. To run our code, navigate into the ui-project-fall24-main folder, and run python server.py in the command line. The separate pages are not yet linked, so to see each page type its respective URL into the browser. 

The routes that should be at the end of the URL for each page are as follows: 
Homepage : '/'
Review form page: '/reviewform'
Professor page: '/professor'
Course page: '/course'
